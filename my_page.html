        <p>**About Me**

            I’m a Ventura, California native with a creative spirit and a passion for forging my own path. Growing up with a world-traveling mother and a free-spirited, craftsman father, I learned to embrace life’s twists and turns. Over the years, I’ve cultivated my skills as a cosmetologist, business owner, and software enthusiast, blending a strong background in management, design, and full-stack development to shape a new future.  
            
            Life has brought its share of challenges, including profound loss and personal growth. Despite these trials, I’m focused on building a brighter, more independent, and fulfilling future. Alongside my adorable Shorkie, who never leaves my side, I’m excited to explore new opportunities and continue evolving personally and professionally. </p>
